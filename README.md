Interface for Physicians and Ophthalmologist to perform several visual acuity tests 
This is just the first demo for this project. I am uploading this repository as for right now, to be able to register to the competition for VandyHacks VI Art Edition

Purpose of the Project: to create an interface that physicians and ophtalmologist can use to perfom visual acuity exams on a patient. NOTE: this is just the interface, this is not an invasive product towards the patient. We are providing the graphics to the ophtalmologists to use to perform the exams. 

Busines Model we are trying to tackle: Physicians and ophalmologists require expensive hardware and software for the visual graphics to perform eye examinations. We are builidng an efficient interface that can adapt to any screen monitor that people from the medical field can use to perfrom visual acuity exams. 
The program can also be loaded to a raspberry pi. this is important because like that, doctors can go on medical trips to rural areas around the world, and they will only need a monitor to plug in the raspberry pi and run the interface. 

Main Interface Technologies: HTML5,JavaScript,CSS3,mediaQueries,BootStrap
You will also notice that we have several other files: Processing files -> Matching Art Edition of the Hackathon -> We built tools in processing to manipulate images. The main takeaway was the tool to alter an image with code to change the color of the image at the pixel level to be able to transform the image of an art piece to an image that can be used for the Color Blindness Exam.

Later I will upload the Python work of a team-mate were he built a neural network to predict the impact that our product will produce to the stock market in regards of the medical industry. 

There's also a weather API on the interface. the weather information was obtained by openweathermap.com
